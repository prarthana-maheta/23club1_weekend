# Write a Python program to count 
# the number of strings from a given 
# list of strings. The string length 
# is 2 or more and the first and last characters are the same.
# Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
# Expected Result : 2


# Write a Python program to 
# print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements.
# Sample List : ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow']
# Expected Output : ['Green', 'White', 'Black']


# Write a Python program to get the frequency of elements in a list.
# my_list = [10, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 20, 20, 40, 40, 50, 50, 30]

# Write a Python program to convert a list of 
# multiple integers into a single integer.
# Sample list: [11, 33, 50]
# Expected Output: 113350

# l1=[11, 33, 50]
# l2=[]
# for i in l1:
#     l2.append(str(i))
# print(''.join(l2))
